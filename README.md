# Real-Time-Machine-Learning

Each homework has its own README. Open each directory to read it.

## List of the projects

- HW 1: Pre Processing The Data - Deep Learning Classifier - Linear Regression
- HW 2: Building a Neural Network From Scratch for Image Classification

Because of my work, I did not need to do the rest of the projects and HWs
Each Directory has its own README.
